# Abstract

OSCON and big ideas go together.
You're here because you have big ideas of what your company or project can do.
You'll leave the conference ready to hit the ground running.
Yet on the ground it often takes more than raw passion, excitement, and energy to turn your dream into reality.
If your idea involves influencing the behavior of large numbers of individuals, you've entered the realm of culture change at scale.

Scaled culture change is hard.
It requires you to exert lasting influence on people and processes that are not in your direct control.
Almost always the driving motivations of these actors are not in alignment with your idea.
Attempts to mandate influence and alignment via organizational fiat have limited sustained efficacy.

This presentation discusses proven strategies for sustained culture change at scale.
We'll share real anecdotes of successful culture change at Nike and the underlying principles upon which they are based.
We'll make it fun and approachable with everyday analogies and metaphors to make the content easy to remember.
We'll also share the industry-published works that contain the backing content that corroborates our experience.
