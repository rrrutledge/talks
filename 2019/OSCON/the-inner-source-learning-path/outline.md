# Abstract

While simple to define, InnerSource can be difficult to explain and implement successfully on a broad corporate scale.
Many participating engineers lack background in open source and the ideas and mechanics of open code development.
Even those with that background face a new set of constraints and motivations when trying to work openly within an enterprise.

The InnerSource Learning Path (http://bit.ly/inner-source-learning-path) can help.
It gives a simple, easy-to-understand introduction to InnerSource.
Its video segments and written articles introduce key terms, concepts, and principles for effective InnerSource activity along with explanations and real-world examples.
Advanced segments deep dive into explanation of the specific roles of InnerSource and how to fill them effectively.
The learning path brings newcomers up to speed and also provides those with experience a common vocabulary and resource to use when discussing InnerSource.
We'll review the content of the learning path and how you can access it for yourself and share it with others.

The Learning Path is an effective way of teaching the basics of InnerSource, but many advanced topics require more discussion and training.
The InnerSource Commons is an online community with with resources to help.
It has an active, online chat group and mailing list as well as several working groups to plan:
* Patterns
* Summits
* Learning Path.

The session includes:

a short introduction to inner source.
an explanation of the problems that inner source can solve.
an overview of the mechanics and roles of inner source.
a review of the key benefits of inner source.
a deeper look at the key roles of inner source.
