# One-sentence description of your presentation

# Topic

Sustainable Open Source

# Abstract

Inner source is the application of open source methods to company-internal software.
It's an effective strategy for running shared internal projects and also for developing the people and organizational skills and muscle for wide and deep involvement in open source.
While simple to define, inner source can be difficult to explain and implement successfully on a broad corporate scale.
Many participating engineers lack background in open source and the ideas and mechanics of open code development.
Even those with that background face a new set of constraints and motivations when trying to work openly within an enterprise.

The Inner Source Learning Path (http://bit.ly/inner-source-learning-path) can help.
It gives a simple, easy-to-understand introduction to inner source.
Its video segments and written articles introduce key terms, concepts, and principles for effective inner sourcing along with explanations and real-world examples.
Advanced segments deep dive into explanation of the specific roles of inner source and how to fill them effectively.
The learning path brings newcomers up to speed and also provides those with experience a common vocabulary and resource to use when discussing inner source.

We'll review the content of the learning path and how you can access it for yourself and share it with others.
