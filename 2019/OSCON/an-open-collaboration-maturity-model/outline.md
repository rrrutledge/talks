# Abstract

(_copied from the [proposal](https://github.com/rrrutledge/talks/blob/master/2019/OSCON/an-open-collaboration-maturity-model/proposal.md)_)

You've got big ideas on how your company should develop an open source culture more fully. You can see the value that change will bring. Yet as you try to share your ideas they're just not sticking. People don't seem to see their importance or perhaps give vocal assent but don't actually make on-the-ground changes in behavior. You may be wondering if your organization or team just isn't ready for open source. What can you do to move your company and its people towards a more collaborative and open culture?

We believe that every person and organization is ready to incorporate more open source principles and activity into their regular work. This presentation discusses how to make that change happen, no matter what the current engagement or proficiency level of the people or team you're working with. To frame this discussion we'll present The Collaboration Maturity Model, a unified way of representing multi-participant collaboration both within and without a company. The model is easy to remember and shows how strictly open source activity relates to and is supported by other forms of collaboration in and out of your organization.

The Collaboration Maturity Model gives you a map of guideposts to follow on your organization's journey towards open source. You'll easily be able to find where you are, where you want to go, and the small, incremental checkpoints that you can hit on your way there. As you listen to and gain ideas from other sessions of the conference, you'll be able to mentally plot where those ideas apply in the maturity model and focus on those that lie squarely in your incremental path of growth towards open source culture.

# Audience

People interested in spreading open culture within their large organization.

# Takeaways

Learn the relationship between open source participation and other collaborative behavior. This understanding will help you to plot next incremental steps between your current position and your open source goals.

# Timing

30 minutes speaking
10 minutes questions

# Outline

## Introduction

* Motivation to change involves more than just a desirable destimation.
  * Give a picturesque description of Portland.  How many could see themselves visiting in the near future?
  * Give a picturesque description of Mars.  How many could see themselves visiting in the near future?
  * What makes travelling to Portland more attractive than travelling to Mars?
    - Don't know how to make the trip.
    - Don't know of anyone that has made the trip.  Would need to pioneer.
    - All of the value comes at the end.
    - Too expensive.
    - All expense is at the front.
  * Give some extra description of the fabulous benefits of visiting Mars.  Point out how doubling down on the message doesn't do anything to allay the concerns.
* The journey to open collaboration is daunting for many.
  * Give a picturesque description of open collaboration.  How many could see themselves visiting in the near future?
  * Has anyone had a Mars-like commitment/response when trying to sell a journey to open collaboration?
  * When many of us hear a description of open collaboration it sounds like the trip to Portland.  Others may hear the exact words and it sounds to them like a trip to Mars.
  * Show how the same concepts that give trepidation for a trip to Mars also apply to open collaboration.

* Summary of the rest of the presentation.
* This presentation explains how to guide people through this process.
* The collaboration maturity model is like a map.

## Body

* How a map helps in a journey.
  * Show a blank screen with a dot representing Portland on it.  It's not useful without any extra context.
  * One-by-one add pieces of context onto the map.
    * Chicago (Starting point).
    * Towns along the way (Stopping points).
    * Interstate (Path).
  * These same attributes to help chart out a physical journey also apply to charting a cultural journey to open collaboration and open source.

* The maturity model is a map to open collaboration and open source.
  * We'll explain the model and how to use it in your journey.
  * The map is composed of multiple dimensions along with collaboration occurs.
  * Each dimension is represented by a vector.
  * Behaviors further right tend to require higher skill to do but also have a higher potential payoff.
    * All else being equal.
    * This is not to say that every instance of further-right behavior is superior to further-left behaviors
      * Just that in some situations it can be that way.
      * In the end you want to have all behaviors in your toolbelt so that you can use the one appropriate for the situation.
      * This is growing in maturity, that you have the ability to use all behaviors in all dimensions in the appropriate situation.

* The dimensions of the maturity model
  * Location
    * sync F2F, sync digital, async
    * meeting, conference-call/chat, pull-request/issue/ticket/wiki/shared-document comments.
  * Artifact
    * talk, docs, code
    * presentation/demo/discussion, issue/ticket/user-docs, code
  * Criticality
    * side, ancillary, mainline
    * passion project, supports mainline project, day job
  * Organization
    * Cross-team, cross-domain, cross-business-unit, cross-company
    * Multiple teams in your domain, multiple domains in your business unit, multiple business unit in your company, multiple companies.

* How to use the maturity model
  * Open source is the right-most activity on all dimensions.  That is where we want to be.
  * The maturity model gives you a map.  You can plot out where you are now.
  * There are clear stopping points between where you are at now and your destination.
  * Progress doesn't have to be a quantum leap to the end.  Sliding up along _any_ dimension is progress toward open collaboration and open source.
  * Each stopping point gives incremental value so it's not one huge, heavy, single lift.
  * It's better just to pick one.
  * The one you pick should be an incremental improvement from where you are at now.  You'll hear all kinds of ideas.  They're all good ideas, depending on where you're at and what's your next step.  First plot where you're at, then you'll know which good idea should come next.
  * We find that teams naturally want to move up the scale in some way even though they don't know about it.  Just need to figure out where they're already pulling for it and help them out.
  * Give an example of helping teams to slide up the scale.
  * Review how the useful parts of a physical map also apply to how this maturity model helps with open collaboration and open source.  Starting point, Stopping points, Path.

* You can have a central program that aids teams in sliding up the scale in batch.
  * You can rate your central program based on the same maturity model.
  * Types of activities where this central program might participate
    * Internal community and speaking forums.
    * Internal blog.
    * Inner Source.
    * Hackathons.
    * Open source.
  * You pick the next program based off of what people need next.
  * If someone isn't ready for open source then you can get them ready.
  * You can think of a 5th dimension on the model - number of teams in your reachh.

## Conclusion

* The principles of a successful physical journey also apply to the cultural journey towards open collaboration and open source.
I'ts not enough just to have a desirable destination.
You also need:
  * To know where you are now.
  * Path to get from where you are to where you want to be.
  * Clear value stops along the way.
* The Open Collaboration Maturity Model is a map that gives all of those in this journey.
It's dimensions are:
  * Location
  * Artifact
  * Criticality
  * Organization
* You use the model by helping people/teams to advance one step at a time, one dimension at a time.
* A central program makes it easier to do so and in batch.
* Use the maturity model in your open evangelization efforts.
* My contact information.  email, _Slack_.

## Appendix

Some great thoughts that didn't seem to have a place in the final result

Bring in the community meetup schedule.

Review the principle of opt-in.  Remove the barrier that is preventing them to collaborate.

Sometimes the thing that is needed is visibilty and evangelism, but sometimes on the ground there is some other point of friction that needs to be addressed.

Training.  Tooling.  Documentation.


Could also have a description of some intermediate location - an out-of-the-way location on Earth.

* Use the opt-in principle to encourage change.
  * You may encounter resistance to change.
  * A lot of times it's because of the mountain of difficulty when moving.

    * Rocky Mountains (Obstacles).


* The maturity model is a map to open collaboration.  It's a map that is easy to remember yet large enough to cover the whole world.

Great time to bring in the idea of knocking down the mountain instead of pushing them over it.

It's like I just keep telling you how great things are on the other side and hoping that will give you enough motivation to go over the mountain.

This is like some people and the journey to Mars.  Replace the person and the hill and the destination with someone traveling to open source instead of to Mars.
