(_copied from the [proposal](https://github.com/rrrutledge/talks/blob/master/2019/OSCON/an-open-collaboration-maturity-model/proposal.md)_)

You've got big ideas on how your company should develop an open source culture more fully. You can see the value that change will bring. Yet as you try to share your ideas they're just not sticking. People don't seem to see their importance or perhaps give vocal assent but don't actually make on-the-ground changes in behavior. You may be wondering if your organization or team just isn't ready for open source. What can you do to move your company and its people towards a more collaborative and open culture?

We believe that every person and organization is ready to incorporate more open source principles and activity into their regular work. This presentation discusses how to make that change happen, no matter what the current engagement or proficiency level of the people or team you're working with. To frame this discussion we'll present The Collaboration Maturity Model, a unified way of representing multi-participant collaboration both within and without a company. The model is easy to remember and shows how strictly open source activity relates to and is supported by other forms of collaboration in and out of your organization.

The Collaboration Maturity Model gives you a map of guideposts to follow on your organization's journey towards open source. You'll easily be able to find where you are, where you want to go, and the small, incremental checkpoints that you can hit on your way there. As you listen to and gain ideas from other sessions of the conference, you'll be able to mentally plot where those ideas apply in the maturity model and focus on those that lie squarely in your incremental path of growth towards open source culture.

# Audience

People interested in spreading open culture within their large organization.

# Takeaways

Learn the relationship between open source participation and other collaborative behavior. This understanding will help you to plot next incremental steps between your current position and your open source goals.

# Timing

30 minutes speaking
10 minutes questions

# Outline

* Introduction
  * Motivation to change involves more than just a desirable destimation.
    * Give a picturesque description of Portland.  How many could see themselves visiting in the near future?
    * Give a picturesque description of Mars.  How many could see themselves visiting in the near future?
    * What makes travelling to Portland more attractive than travelling to Mars?
      - Don't know how to make the trip.
      - Don't know of anyone that has made the trip.  Would need to pioneer.
      - All of the value comes at the end.
      - Too expensive.
      - All expense is at the front.
    * Give some extra description of the fabulous benefits of visiting Mars.  Point out how doubling down on the message doesn't do anything to allay the concerns.
  * Give a picturesque description of open collaboration.  How many could see themselves visiting in the near future?
  * Has anyone had a Mars-like commitment/response when trying to sell a journey to open collaboration?
  * When many of us hear a description of open collaboration it sounds like the trip to Portland.  Others may hear the exact words and it sounds to them like a trip to Mars.
  * Show how

Some people see it like visiting Mars.


What is the problem?  The problem is that you want people to engage in open source more than they are.

Sunny Portland.



Could also have a description of some intermediate location - an out-of-the-way location on Earth.

Give a description of how wonderful open source or open habits are.
When people don't hear you does it sound like Mars or Portland to them?
If you didn't want to go to Mars what if I doubled down on telling you how great

Great time to bring in the idea of knocking down the mountain instead of pushing them over it.

It's like I just keep telling you how great things are on the other side and hoping that will give you enough motivation to go over the mountain.

This is like some people and the journey to Mars.  Replace the person and the hill and the destination with someone traveling to open source instead of to Mars.

You could just say that your company isn't ready for Open Source, but you could actually help them to get ready instead.

You need a map.  When you travelled to Portland it wasn't enough to just know, Portland, Portalnd, Portland (single dot on the map).  You also need to where you are now and what lies in-between you and Portland (so that you can plan out how to get from where you are now and your destination)

Here is a map to full open source participation (4 dimensions)

1.  Location
1.  Artifact
1.  Content
1.  Organization

There could be a 5th dimension, too, which is number of teams.  It is also growth to have more people working together, even if at the same level as before.

Really talk about the idea of _maximum_ potential being limited.  Do not need to imply that the correct tool for every job is the one that has maximum potential value.

Lower or higher _potential_ maturity.  What do you have in your toolbelt?

Give concete examples of activities at the various levels of maturity.

Each of these points provides value

Every individual, every team needs to move up the continuum.

You don't need to move up all dimensions at once.  Usually at any one point in time you just move up one of the dimensions with the others holding constant.

You need to choose what's next based off of where people are now and what's the next step to tem.

We find that people naturally want to move up this continuum (to the next step, that is).

Assume that people want to move up but something is in their way.  Remove the barrier to entry.  Sometimes it's just as simple as telling them that they need to move up.

Training.  Tooling.  Documentation.

Some examples of how people have moved up.  Bring in the community meetup schedule.

Review the principle of opt-in.  Remove the barrier that is preventing them to collaborate.

Sometimes the thing that is needed is visibilty and evangelism, but sometimes on the ground there is some other point of friction that needs to be addressed.

You can use this same maturity model to evaluate your own open collaboration programs and where they can grow.
