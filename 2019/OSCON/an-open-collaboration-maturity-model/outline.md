# Abstract

(_copied from the [proposal](https://github.com/rrrutledge/talks/blob/master/2019/OSCON/an-open-collaboration-maturity-model/proposal.md)_)

You've got big ideas on how your company should develop an open source culture more fully. You can see the value that change will bring. Yet as you try to share your ideas they're just not sticking. People don't seem to see their importance or perhaps give vocal assent but don't actually make on-the-ground changes in behavior. You may be wondering if your organization or team just isn't ready for open source. What can you do to move your company and its people towards a more collaborative and open culture?

We believe that every person and organization is ready to incorporate more open source principles and activity into their regular work. This presentation discusses how to make that change happen, no matter what the current engagement or proficiency level of the people or team you're working with. To frame this discussion we'll present The Collaboration Maturity Model, a unified way of representing multi-participant collaboration both within and without a company. The model is easy to remember and shows how strictly open source activity relates to and is supported by other forms of collaboration in and out of your organization.

The Collaboration Maturity Model gives you a map of guideposts to follow on your organization's journey towards open source. You'll easily be able to find where you are, where you want to go, and the small, incremental checkpoints that you can hit on your way there. As you listen to and gain ideas from other sessions of the conference, you'll be able to mentally plot where those ideas apply in the maturity model and focus on those that lie squarely in your incremental path of growth towards open source culture.

# Audience

People interested in spreading open culture within their organization.

# Takeaways

Learn the relationship between open source participation and other collaborative behavior. This understanding will help you to plot next incremental steps between your current position and your open source goals.
