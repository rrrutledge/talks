# Session Title (max. 20 words)
The InnerSource Learning Path

# Session Abstract (max. 250 words)
Inner source is the application of open source methodologies to internally-developed software.
While simple to define, inner source can be difficult to explain and implement successfully.
Many engineers lack the background in open source and the ideas and mechanics of open code development.
Even those with that background face a new set of constraints and motivations when trying to work openly within the enterprise.

The Inner Source Learning Path gives a simple, easy to understand introduction to inner source.
It introduces key terms, concepts, and principles for effective inner sourcing along with explanations and real examples.
It is intended to bring newcomers up to speed as well as provide those with experience a common vocabulary to use when discussing more advanced concepts.

The Inner Source Learning path will be freely hosted by O'Reilly Media at https://www.safaribooksonline.com/learning-paths for your use and sharing.
More advanced segments of the learning path are forthcoming, and we'll outline how you can get involved.

# Session Detailed Description (max. 1,000 words)
We'll review the content of the learning path and how you can access it for yourself and share it with others.
The session includes:
* a short introduction to inner source.
* an explanation of the problems that inner source can solve.
* an overview of the mechanics and roles of inner source.
* a review of the key benefits of inner source.
* a deeper look at the key roles of inner source.
  * Product Owner
  * Trusted Committer
  * Contributor
* a summary of concepts and links to the online learning path resources.

## Outline

#### Introduction

* Quick definition of inner source
* Inner source is an interesting problem because
  * Not everyone that needs to participate in inner source is already trained in open source.
  * Different constraints and motivations are at play within the enterprise.
* Outline of this presentation
  * Example situation.
  * Mechanics of inner source.
  * Benefits and principles.
  * Online resources to share with others.
  * How you can get involved.

#### Example Situation
* Not the only situation that calls for inner source.
* Complex enough to illustrate many of the parts of inner source.
* Simple enough to understand
* Spoken text from the learning path

#### Inner Source
* Instead of a feature request, submit a pull request.
* Quick summary of the benefits of inner source.
* Introduce (and define) the 5 key terms related to players in an inner source contribution:
**Guest** (team), **Host** (team), **Product Owner**, **Contributor**, **Trusted Committer**.
* Anatomy of an inner source contribution:
  1.  Guest team requests a feature from the host team.
  1.  Product owner ensures that user stories representing the feature request are created. These stories should describe the requested feature in terms agreeable to the guest team. They also list any details from the host team on how the feature should be delivered in order for the work to be accepted. Examples of such details include architecture constraints, coding conventions, dependency usages, data contracts, etc.
  1.  Supported by the trusted committer(s), the contributor submits the pull request(s) to implement the requested feature.
* Note that these steps do not assume a specific system for the general organization of a team's time or priorities (e.g. _Scrum_, _Kanban_).
Inner source assumes that teams already have existing such methods of organization and provides a framework of how to use them to work together where there is a guest team desiring to contribute code to a host.

#### Benefits

* Guest team gets what they want, when they want it, without having to maintain it.
* Host team gets a new feature that they didn't have to build.
* Scalable strategy for balancing and filling the need of many consumers.
* Requirements and prioritization alignment.
* Break down traditional company silos.
* Fun place to work.
  
#### The Learning Path
* To summarize, we've:
  * given an example situation where inner source can help.
  * discussed the drawbacks that come from the normal responses of **Wait it Out**, **Work Around**, and **Escalate**.
  * outlined the flow of an inner source contribution (key words of **Guest** (team), **Host** (team), **Product Owner**, **Contributor**, **Trusted Committer**)
  * discussed the benefits and principles of inner source.
* This content is available to share with others as an O'Reilly Learning Path (link)
  * watch it, share it, and consider using the key terms in future conversations and writing.
* There is more training coming.  The same modular, multi-media approach to habits and patterns for success as a contributor, trusted committer, and product owner involved with inner source.
* There is opportunity to get involved in the production of those future modules.  Lots of ways to be involved:
  * Speaker.  Produce and give the speaking content.
  * Speaking reviewer.  Review and give feedback to the speaker.
  * Writer.  Produce the written copy.
  * Writing reviewer.  Review and give feedback to the writer.
  * Post-production.  Make slides and any other post-production artifacts.
  * Post-production reviewer.  Review post-production work.
* Share my own experience on being involved in the process.
* Leave an emoji if you want to get involved.

## Takeaways
After attending this presentation, we hope that viewers will:

* Understand and use the key terms and principles shared in the learning path.
* View and share the learning path videos.
* Sign up to help on working on any future segments in the learning path.
