The Collaboration Maturity Model

# Session Abstract (max. 250 words)
You've got big ideas on how your company should adopt InnerSource.
You can see the value that change will bring.
Yet as you try to share your ideas they're just not sticking.
People don't seem to see their importance or perhaps give vocal assent but don't actually make on-the-ground changes in behavior.
You may be wondering if your organization or team just isn't ready for InnerSource.

We believe that every person and organization is ready to incorporate more InnerSource principles and activity into their regular work.
This presentation discusses how to make that change happen, no matter what the current engagement or proficiency level of the people or team you're working with.
To frame this discussion we'll present The Collaboration Maturity Model, a unified way of representing multi-participant collaboration both within a company.
The model is easy to remember and shows how strictly InnerSource activity relates to and is supported by other forms of collaboration in and out of your organization.

The Collaboration Maturity Model gives you a map of guideposts to follow on your organization's journey towards InnerSource.
You'll easily be able to find where you are, where you want to go, and the small, incremental checkpoints that you can hit on your way there.
As you listen to and gain ideas from other sessions of the conference, you'll be able to mentally plot where those ideas apply in the maturity model and focus on those that lie squarely in your incremental path of growth towards InnerSource culture.

# Session Detailed Description (max. 1,000 words)

## Outline

* Frame introducing an InnerSource program as a journey.
* Teach the principles of a successful journey (start, destination, stops, route) using a real-life physical journey as an example.
* Introduce the maturity model as providing all elements of a successful journey as it relates to a cultural journey to InnerSource.
* Review the dimensions of the maturity model: Location, Artifact, Criticality, and Organization.
* Explain how to map cultural position and movement to the maturity model.
* The maturity model can be used to evaluate and guide an individual team or your InnerSource Program in-general.

## Takeaways
After attending this presentation, we hope that viewers will:

* View the culture change to InnerSource as a continuous journey rather than a single step.
* Use the dimensions in the maturity model to evaluate the health of their InnerSource program.
* Use the incremental growth paths in the maturity model to pick how to uplevel InnerSource at their company.
