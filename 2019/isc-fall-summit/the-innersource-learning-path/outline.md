# Abstract

InnerSource is the application of open source methodologies to internally-developed software. While simple to define, inner source can be difficult to explain and implement successfully. Many engineers lack the background in open source and the ideas and mechanics of open code development. Even those with that background face a new set of constraints and motivations when trying to work openly within the enterprise.

The InnerSource Learning Path gives a simple, easy to understand introduction to InnerSource. It introduces key terms, concepts, and principles for effective inner sourcing along with explanations and real examples. It is intended to bring newcomers up to speed as well as provide those with experience a common vocabulary to use when discussing more advanced concepts.

The InnerSource Learning path will be freely hosted at innersourcecommons.org for your use and sharing. More advanced segments of the learning path are forthcoming, and we'll outline how you can get involved.

# Audience

People that need to train others in InnerSource, especially those that are developing training material for that purpose.

# Takeaways

After attending this presentation, we hope that viewers will:

* Understand and use the key terms shared in the learning path.
* View and share the learning path videos.
* Sign up to help in finishing the learning path.

# Outline

## Motivation

* Brief introduction of InnerSource and its benefits.
* Reference some points that have been brought up in other talks.
* Problems in trying to implement InnerSource:
  - Lacking background in open source.
  - Different constraints and motivations are present in InnerSource
    * different approaches are needed to produce the same type of collaboration.
    * discoverability can be more difficult.
    * people want to get their day job done.
    * higher responsiveness expected.
* Getting InnerSource right the first time is important to avoid brand dilution.
Contrast with botched rollout of agile.
* The learning path is scaled training	on InnerSource.
  - Modules of information each covering one aspect of InnerSource.
  - The information in each module, or segment, is presented in video and written format.
    * Show a short video clip and its associated article.
  - Sponsored by PayPal.
  - Working in partnership with O'Reilly media.
  - This content is destined to be freely-available to the world.
  
## Terminology

* It's important to use common, shared terms.
  - The practice of InnerSource is new and we all are still figuring it out.
  - Using common terminology to refer to the same thing helps our writing and speaking to be more understandable and useful to each other.
* Review and explain common terminology
  - In the context of an InnerSource contribution: Guest, Host, Product Owner, Contributor, Trusted Committer
    * Product Owner and Trusted Committer roles can be filled by a single person.
  - Anti-patterns to InnerSource are Wait it Out, Work Around, and Escalate.
    * Identifying an anti-behavior as such motivates usage of the correct behavior.
    * Each of these are the same number of syllables as "InnerSource".
* Show a video clip explaining some of this terminology.

## Creating the Learning Path.

* Breakdown of the learning path into sections and segments.
* Run as an open source project.
  - Outlines, scripts, and articles checked into _GitHub_ via pull request.
  - Kanban board tracks progress on tasks.
  - Continuous chat in the #learning-path _Slack_ channel.
  - Weekly call for items that are easier to discuss synchronously.
* Thanks to our contributors (count of people and companies).
* Status of work in the learning path.
* Call to participate.
  - Pool your efforts in creating training material with others in the industry.
  - Influence the content of the learning path to include your company's scenarios.
  - Develop working relationships with others in the commons.
  - Be a part of the behind-the-scenes working relationship with Oâ€™Reilly media.
  - Join the #learning-path channel.
