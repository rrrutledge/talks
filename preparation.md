This is how I go about creating a presentation.
I've listed out the phases of prepration as well as the approximate timing of each phase (in relation to the length of the presentation).

# Outline

First, I make an outline of what I want to share.
This outline includes a description of the audience, what I want them to take away from the presentation, and and abstract of the content.
It also includes a detailed list of bullet points describing the flow of the presentation.

The purpose of this outline is to organize my thoughts at a high level in a way that is relatively cheap to iterate on.
I want to have the main flow solid to avoid expensive rework on a more finished version.

**Time: 2x**

# Slides

I translate the outline to a slide deck and get quick, Ignite!-style visuals for each slide.

**Time: 3x**

# Raw Rehearsal

I try to give the presentation based on the slides.
The purpose is to see where the flow of ideas is unnatural or needs to be augmented.
I also can see how the slide images or content need update.
I incorporate feedback and ideas in realtime as I am talking.
Eventually I get through it once.

**Time: 3x**

# Rough Rehearsal

I do a rehearsal of the presentation.
It's still pretty rough.

**Time: x**

# Polished Rehearsal

I view the rough rehearsal.
I incorporate any feedback.
I rehearse again.

**Time: 5x**

# Final Rehearsal

I view the polished rehearsal.
I incorporate any feedback.
I rehearse one last time.
This rehearsal is usually done close to the time of giving the actual presentation.

The purpose is to have a solid, sparkling run that incorporates all of the feedback and gives confidence to the actual upcoming presentation.

**Time: 3x**
