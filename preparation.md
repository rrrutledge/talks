This is how I go about creating a presentation.

# Outline

First, I make an outline of what I want to share.
This outline includes a description of the audience, what I want them to take away from the presentation, and and abstract of the content.
It also includes a detailed list of bullet points describing the flow of the presentation.

The purpose of this outline is to organize my thoughts at a high level in a way that is relatively cheap to iterate on.
I want to have the main flow solid to avoid expensive rework on a more finished version.

# Slides

I translate the outline to a slide deck and get quick, Ignite!-style visuals for each slide.

# 1st Rehearsal

I read through the slides in a very rough way.
The purpose is to see where the flow of ideas is unnatural or needs to be augmented.
I also can see how the slide images or content need update.

I incorporate my feedback.

# Rough Rehearsal

I do a rehearsal of the presentation.
It's still pretty rough

I view the rough rehearsal.
I incorporate any feedback.

# Polished Rehearsal

I rehearse again.

I view the rough rehearsal.
I incorporate any feedback.

# Final Rehearsal

I rehearse one last time.
This rehearsal is usually done close to the time of giving the actual presentation.

The purpose is to have a solid, sparkling run that incorporates all of the feedback and gives confidence to the actual upcoming presentation.
