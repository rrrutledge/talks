# Abstract

InnerSource is more than telling someone the mechanics of code and community management.
It is a culture change that needs to be nurtured and supported.
Like all culture change, it can be encouraged from the top-down but grows out of energy from the bottom up.
How can we foster real InnerSource culture change at an enterprise-wide scale?
Come and see how we work at Nike to create an culture ripe for InnerSource and leverage data to scale that culture company-wide.

# Outline

* Preview of the talk - How are accomplishing InnerSource culture change through social and data-driven means.
* Approach to culture change.
  * Sustained InnerSource is a culture change.
  * The key to sustainable culture change is voluntary participation.
    * Your new culture has to be attractive and useful enough so that people want to participate.
    * Leadership can make space to permit people to voluntarily participate, but cannot be the reason that people participate.
    * Example of the tree and the supporting rod.
* The Collaboration Grid.
  * Peoples' opportunities and constraints did not make InnerSource an attractive, sustainable option.
  * InnerSource is a piece on a larger collaboration continuum.
  * Rather than overcome our difficulty through leadership pressure, we encouraged people to get started at a point on the collaboration continuum for which they were ready.
  * As people participate in collaboration, they naturally want to uplevel themselves.
  * Review timeline and results at the company.
* Scaling with Data
  * Data helps us to see the effect that our culture is having and to know where more work is needed.
  * Data can also make it easier for people to engage in the type of culture that we want to see.
  * Summary of the Jeter system.
