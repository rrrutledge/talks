# Title

The Open Collaboration Maturity Model

# Abstract

We believe that every person and organization is ready to incorporate more open source principles and activity into their regular work.
This presentation discusses how to make that change happen, no matter what the current engagement or proficiency level of the people or team you're working with.
To frame this discussion we'll present The Collaboration Maturity Model, a unified way of representing multi-participant collaboration both within and without a company.
The model is easy to remember and shows how strictly open source activity relates to and is supported by other forms of collaboration in and out of your organization.

The Collaboration Maturity Model gives you a map of guideposts to follow on your organization's journey towards open source.
You'll easily be able to find where you are, where you want to go, and the small, incremental checkpoints that you can hit on your way there.
As you listen to and gain ideas from other sessions of the conference, you'll be able to mentally plot where those ideas apply in the maturity model and focus on those that lie squarely in your incremental path of growth towards open source culture.

# Audience

People interested in spreading open culture within their large organization.

# Takeaways

Learn the relationship between open source participation and other collaborative behavior.
This understanding will help you to plot next incremental steps between your current position and your open source goals.

# Outline

* How a map helps in a journey.
  * Show a blank screen with a dot representing Lisbon on it.  It's not useful without any extra context.
  * One-by-one add pieces of context onto the map.
    * Paris (Starting point).
    * Towns along the way (Stopping points).
    * Interstate (Path).
  * These same attributes to help chart out a physical journey also apply to charting a cultural journey to open collaboration and open source.
  
* The maturity model is a map to open collaboration and open source.
  * We'll explain the model and how to use it in your journey.
  * The map is composed of multiple dimensions along with collaboration occurs.
  * Each dimension is represented by a vector.
  * Behaviors further right tend to require higher skill to do but also have a higher potential payoff.
    * All else being equal.
    * This is not to say that every instance of further-right behavior is superior to further-left behaviors
      * Just that in some situations it can be that way.
      * In the end you want to have all behaviors in your toolbelt so that you can use the one appropriate for the situation.
      * This is growing in maturity, that you have the ability to use all behaviors in all dimensions in the appropriate situation.

* The dimensions of the maturity model
  * Location
    * sync F2F, sync digital, async
    * meeting, conference-call/chat, pull-request/issue/ticket/wiki/shared-document comments.
  * Artifact
    * talk, docs, code
    * presentation/demo/discussion, issue/ticket/user-docs, code
  * Criticality
    * side, ancillary, mainline
    * passion project, supports mainline project, day job
  * Organization
    * Cross-team, cross-business-unit, cross-company
    * Multiple teams in your domain, multiple business unit in your company, multiple companies.
  * Partipation
    * Consumer, consultant, creator
    * Listen to a conversation, participate in a conversation, lead a conversation
    * Use open source, open issues in open source, contribute to open source.

* How to use the maturity model
  * Open source is the right-most activity on all dimensions.  That is where we want to be.
  * The maturity model gives you a map.  You can plot out where you are now.
  * There are clear stopping points between where you are at now and your destination.
  * Progress doesn't have to be a quantum leap to the end.  Sliding up along _any_ dimension is progress toward open collaboration and open source.
  * Each stopping point gives incremental value so it's not one huge, heavy, single lift.
  * It's better just to pick one.
  * The one you pick should be an incremental improvement from where you are at now.  You'll hear all kinds of ideas.  They're all good ideas, depending on where you're at and what's your next step.  First plot where you're at, then you'll know which good idea should come next.
  * We find that teams naturally want to move up the scale in some way even though they don't know about it.  Just need to figure out where they're already pulling for it and help them out.
  * Give an example of helping teams to slide up the scale.
  * Review how the useful parts of a physical map also apply to how this maturity model helps with open collaboration and open source.  Starting point, Stopping points, Path.

* The principles of a successful physical journey also apply to the cultural journey towards open collaboration and open source.
It's not enough just to have a desirable destination.
You also need:
  * To know where you are now.
  * Path to get from where you are to where you want to be.
  * Clear value stops along the way.
* The Open Collaboration Maturity Model is a map that gives all of those in this journey.
It's dimensions are:
  * Location
  * Artifact
  * Criticality
  * Organization
  * Participation
* You use the model by helping people/teams to advance one step at a time, one dimension at a time.
* Use the maturity model in your open evangelization efforts.
