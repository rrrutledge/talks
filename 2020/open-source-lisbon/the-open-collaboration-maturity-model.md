# Title

The Open Collaboration Maturity Model

# Abstract

We believe that every person and organization is ready to incorporate more open source principles and activity into their regular work.
This presentation discusses how to make that change happen, no matter what the current engagement or proficiency level of the people or team you're working with.
To frame this discussion we'll present The Collaboration Maturity Model, a unified way of representing multi-participant collaboration both within and without a company.
The model is easy to remember and shows how strictly open source activity relates to and is supported by other forms of collaboration in and out of your organization.

The Collaboration Maturity Model gives you a map of guideposts to follow on your organization's journey towards open source.
You'll easily be able to find where you are, where you want to go, and the small, incremental checkpoints that you can hit on your way there.
As you listen to and gain ideas from other sessions of the conference, you'll be able to mentally plot where those ideas apply in the maturity model and focus on those that lie squarely in your incremental path of growth towards open source culture.

# Audience
