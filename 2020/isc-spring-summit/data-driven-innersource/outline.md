# Abstract

Wide-scale adoption of InnerSource is a state that can feel so close yet many times is so far.
It's a culture change that must be won a single person at a time until the whole organization has shifted.
This type of broad-scale impact is hard and often fizzles before achieving its full potential.
What can help to drive this type of initiative to completion?
***Data***.
Reliable, cheap, accessible data shows how far you've come and where it makes sense to go next.
This insight imbues energy to keep your culture change initiative going past an initial flare-up.

Unfortunately, it's not easy to get the data that you need to inform your InnerSource program.
In this presentation we'll review what we've done at Nike with data for InnerSource.
We'll explain our requirements in choosing a data platform and what scenarios and questions it has enabled and will enable.
We'lll take a peek at how early prototypes are being used and also outline our future plans in both the near and long term.

# Audience

People driving an InnerSource culture change.

# Takeaways

* I understand Nike's data approach to culture change (and think it's cool).
* I will share my data approach with Nike.
* I'm excited to see what they find out with data.

# Outline

* InnerSource culture change is hard.
* Data accelerates large-scale culture change.
  * Proves that you're making progress.
  * Let's you know where to work next.
* We're building an internal data platform to provide us this information.
  * Key requirements of the platform.
  * Scenarios we hope it will enable.
  * Questions for which we'd like to learn answers.
* Eventually will run machine learning on the data for greater insight.
* We will be back to share what we learn.
* Come talk to us about how you are using data in your InnerSource effort.
