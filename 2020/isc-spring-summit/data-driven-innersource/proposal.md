Data-Drive InnerSource

# Session Abstract (max. 250 words)
Wide-scale adoption of InnerSource is a state that can feel so close yet many times is so far.
It's a culture change that must be won a single person at a time until the whole organization has shifted.
This type of broad-scale impact is hard and often fizzles before achieving its full potential.
What can help to drive this type of initiative to completion?
***Data***.
Reliable, cheap, accessible data shows how far you've come and where it makes sense to go next.
This insight imbues energy to keep your culture change initiative going past an initial flare-up.

Unfortunately, it's not easy to get the data that you need to inform your InnerSource program.
In this presentation we'll review what we've done at Nike with data for InnerSource.
We'll explain our requirements in choosing a data platform and what scenarios and questions it has enabled and will enable.
We'll take a peek at how early prototypes are being used and also outline our future plans in both the near and long term.
