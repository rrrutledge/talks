# Session Title (max. 20 words)
Bottom-Up InnerSource Culture

# Session Abstract (max. 250 words)
InnerSource takes successful working patterns from open source and applies them to company-internal software development.
Internal projects, run in this open, collaborative fashion, unlock developer creativity and efficiency.
They balance the needs from multiple parts of the company and reduce siloed, duplicative work.
They foster a dynamic, fulfilling work environment.

In this presentation, we'll explore how to go about introducing an InnerSource working model within your company from the ground up.
We'll look at published patterns of introducing such a culture change and give real-life anecdotes of how those patterns have played out at Nike.
We'll also review the scientific underpinnings of why these patterns work, all in a fun and engaging way with memorable examples.
At the end of the presentation you'll leave with a mental guide of principles to follow in bringing InnerSource behavior to software development inside your company.
