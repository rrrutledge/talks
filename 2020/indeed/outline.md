# Abstract

Open source is a proven way for many hands to create shared software that is useful for all.
The need for scaled, bottom-up code collaboration is just as relevant inside a company.
Software organizations of any reasonable size quickly find pockets of engineers solving the same problems and writing the same code.
InnerSource is the application of open source methodologies to internal software development.
It's a fantastic, grass-roots way to share ideas and code through the enterprise.
Join this time for a discussion on industry examples and learnings on InnerSource.
Afterward we'll consider how these learnings apply to our path at Indeed.
