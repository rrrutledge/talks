# Audience

People that are in the software development process.
Engineers, architects, product, scrum, etc., but all involved in the day-to-day and week-to-week process of producing software.
Not necessarily having been involved before in open source or InnerSource.

# Takeaways

* InnerSource is the application of open source methodologies to company-internal software development.
* Wait it Out, Workaround, and Escalate are anti-patterns in situations that are ideal for InnerSource.
* Key vocabulary words: Guest and Host teams, Contributor, Product Owner, Trusted Committer. 
* InnerSource behavior is a culture change.
* I will use and contribute to the InnerSource Learning Path to deepen my understanding of InnerSource.
* I will join the InnerSource Commons to stay in touch with the latest in industry conversation around InnerSource.

# Abstract

Modern software development involves the engineering of systems that combine hundreds of individual libraries and services.
This strategy allows for faster construction of larger, higher-quality systems as individual teams can specialize and iterate in their specific component(s).
This strategy also introduces the potential for friction as a single increment of consumer-facing value may involve updates to multiple components that are owned by different teams.
Top-down coordination processes like Scaled Agile can help, but eventually the demands of coordination outpace the ability for any centrally-managed process to keep up.
The results are the engineering silos and duplicated work common in any large software organization.

This need to coordinate, cooperate, and share without interaction of a central authoritative presence is very similar to open source software development.
Over 2 decades of collective industry practice have produced successful ways of working and collaborating in such an environment.
InnerSource is the application of these open source methodologies to company-internal software development.
It produces many benefits to problems regularly seen in software engineering.
In this presentation we'll review together the key aspects of InnerSource and patterns for how to apply its principles in daily work.
We'll go over gotchas and pitfalls as well as how to stay in touch with the ongoing industry conversation on InnerSource.
