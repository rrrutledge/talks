# Audience

People that are in the software development process.
Engineers, architects, product, scrum, etc., but all involved in the day-to-day and week-to-week process of producing software.

# Takeaways

* InnerSource is the application of open source methodologies to company-internal software development.
* Wait it Out, Workaround, and Escalate are anti-patterns in situations that are ideal for InnerSource.
* Key vocabulary words: Guest and Host teams, Contributor, Product Owner, Trusted Committer. 
* InnerSource behavior is a culture change.
* I will use and contribute to the InnerSource Learning Path to deepen my understanding of InnerSource.
* I will join the InnerSource Commons to stay in touch with the latest in industry conversation around InnerSource.

# Abstract

Modern software development involves the engineering of systems that combine hundreds of individual libraries and services.
This strategy allows for faster construction of larger, higher-quality systems as individual teams can specialize and iterate in their specific component(s).
This strategy also introduces the potential for friction as a single increment of consumer-facing value may involve updates to multiple components that are owned by different teams.
Top-down coordination processes like Scaled Agile can help, but eventually the demands of coordination outpace the ability for any centrally-managed process to keep up.
The results are the engineering silos and duplicated work common in any large software organization.

This need to coordinate, cooperate, and share without interaction of a central authoritative presence is very similar to open source software development.
Over 2 decades of collective industry practice have produced successful ways of working and collaborating in such an environment.
InnerSource is the application of these open source methodologies to company-internal software development.
It produces many benefits to problems regularly seen in software engineering.
In this presentation we'll review together the key aspects of InnerSource and patterns for how to apply its principles in daily work.
We'll go over gotchas and pitfalls as well as how to stay in touch with the ongoing industry conversation on InnerSource.

# Raw Notes

We'll also go over

We need coordination and cooperation without a central authority.
The way to scale is peer-to-peer.  Like open source.
This need for coordination and cooperation without 

decomposition of software monoliths allows for faster construction

Modern software development encourages the breaking up of a software system into a bunch of independent components for reuse.
This increases software quality because people can become experts in just their area of the software system and the technical stack.
It allows us to build a bigger software system because more people can get involved and each just focus in their area.
However there are problems that come with it.
Now when I want to get something done I don't own my whole tech stack.
This is like open source so InnerSource can borrow from it.

Come and learn the lessons of InnerSource, the basics and common vocabulary.
Skills and resources to help you in your journey and how to stay in touch with the ongoing industry conversation around InnerSource.

Some of the aspects that make

InnerSource: Breaking out of the silo
Complex because of the web of dependencies.

Modern software development breaks up

An interconnected world.
Value streams cut across multiple technical components.
Modular, sharable things.
Stringing together technical components.
Specialized work
Result in wasted work.
Technical coupling instead of business coupling.
There are dependencies.

What is the need for InnerSource?

* Humans are expensive
* Friction
* We can't do it alone.
* Dynamic nature
* Agile
human cost

Show how some of the constraints around OpenSource also apply to scaled InnerSource.

There are these anti-patterns.

Tell my own story about discovering InnerSource.

Here are the gotchas.

We can discover the common attributes that characterize the way that we do InnerSource and then find cross-company patterns of working.
