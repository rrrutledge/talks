# Abstract

InnerSource is the application of open source methodologies to internally-developed software.
This methodology reduces engineering silos and unblocks cross-team dependencies by enabling engineers on different teams collaborate on a common code base.

While simple to define, InnerSource can be difficult to explain and implement successfully
Many engineers lack the background in open source and the ideas and mechanics of open code development.
Even those with that background face a new set of constraints and motivations when trying to work openly within the enterprise.

The InnerSource Learning Path gives a simple, easy to understand introduction to InnerSource.
It introduces key terms, concepts, and principles for effective inner sourcing along with explanations and real examples.
It is intended to bring newcomers up to speed as well as provide those with experience a common vocabulary to use when discussing more advanced concepts.

Come and learn about the InnerSource Learning Path and how you can use it in your company.

# Outline

## Motivation

* Brief introduction of InnerSource and its benefits.
* Reference some points that have been brought up in other talks.
* Problems in trying to implement InnerSource:
