How Should Your OSPO Work with InnerSource?

# Description

InnerSource is the application of open source development methodologies to an organization's internal software development (https://innersourcecommons.org/).
It was recently identified at the top Gartner's strategic trends for software engineering (https://gtnr.it/3tRYdVM),
It is moving up the Gartner hype cycle (https://gtnr.it/4aX1vIa), where the term Open Source Program Office also appeared for the first time.
With this attention, many organizations are creating formal programs to support InnerSource.
These programs often appear in close to, in collaboration with, or even inside an OSPO.
Why are organizations with OSPOs strengthening their relationships and investments in InnerSource?
How should an OSPO relate to a company's InnerSource program?
We'll review approaches taken and lessons learned based on many company's experiences as shared in the TODO group and the InnerSource Commons.
We'll summarize considerations to take into account when planning how to successfully navigate this relationship and opportunity in your own organization.
