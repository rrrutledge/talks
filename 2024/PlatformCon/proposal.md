# Abstract

I was a individual application engineer at Nike with the idea of a company-wide web deployment platform.
Unable to get funding for a team to build it,
I partnered, created, and rallied an internal development community that took this idea from skunk works side project to running 88% of all web projects at the company.
Come for the fun, entertaining, and inspiring story of how it happened and what lessons you can apply in your own dreams of internal development and deployment platforms.
