Reimagining Support for InnerSource: Lessons Learned from Market Economics

# Description

With InnerSource moving up the [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-11-28-gartner-hype-cycle-shows-ai-practices-and-platform-engineering-will-reach-mainstream-adoption-in-software-engineering-in-two-to-five-years?mc_cid=0fc03067bf&mc_eid=d4411f3314),
many OSPOs are engaging in support of InnerSource.
This talk introduces a powerful metaphor for how to give this support: The Market Economy.
We examine the mechanisms and incentives that a market economy uses to encourage the formation and spread of value-adding businesses in a society
We show how those same patterns can be used to encourage the formation and spead of value-adding InnerSource projects in a company.
We look at where business failure can happen, how it is handled, and how that applies to InnerSource projects.
This talk is a visionary, discussion-provoking talk that is meant to open up new conversations for us as a community.

# Benefits to the Ecosystem

Many principles of open source and open collaboration are at odds with common processes of corporate software delivery.
We have some help to get around this obstacle with open source since development can happen outside of the digital boundaries of the corporation.
Not so with InnerSource - our only hope for wide-scaled adoption of InnerSource is to adjust the processes and incentives at play in an organization.
It turns out that the setup of a market economy provides a perfect, widely-understood metaphor to show just how this could look and what is wrong with common incentive structures present at organizations today.
This talk reimagines how to create a company from the ground-up with the setup needed for wide-scaled InnerSource AND robust business results.
This picture is likely not the next step for any organization present,
but painting a clear picture of this off-in-the-distance ideal focuses light on what problems are holding back InnerSource today and gives motivation to overcome them.
