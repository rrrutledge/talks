# Abstract

With InnerSource moving up the [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-11-28-gartner-hype-cycle-shows-ai-practices-and-platform-engineering-will-reach-mainstream-adoption-in-software-engineering-in-two-to-five-years?mc_cid=0fc03067bf&mc_eid=d4411f3314),
many OSPOs are engaging in support of InnerSource.
This talk introduces a powerful metaphor for how to give this support: The Market Economy.
We examine the mechanisms and incentives that a market economy uses to encourage the formation and spread of value-adding businesses in a society
and how those same patterns can be used to encourage the formation and spead of value-adding InnerSource projects in a company.
We look at where business failure can happen, how it is handled, and how that applies to InnerSource projects.
This talk is a visionary, discussion-provoking talk that is meant to open up new conversations for us as a community.

# Outline

* Introduction of self and background.
* Summary of what is InnerSource, its history, and industry position.
* This talk is a visionary, discussion-provoking talk rather than a hands-on advice talk.
It is meant to create questions for us to consider as a community rather than to give answers to implement.
* How to make InnerSource grow?
* Model for supporting InnerSource: The Gardner
  * Create the right conditions to give projects the chance to grow.
  * This model doesn't account for the industrial forces at play in an organization.
* Alternative model for supporting InnerSource: The Market
  * Treat InnerSource projects as businesses.
  * Treat project consumers and contributors as customers.
  * Treat engineering time as currency.
* Set up feedback loops and interactions between these elements to mimic the successful setup of a market economy.
Show how these real-world business concepts map onto these elements of this InnerSource model:
  * Business profit and loss.
  * Profit reinvestiment and business expansion.
  * Advising and coaching.
  * Consumer demand.
  * Seed funding.
  * Sales and marketing.
  * Business loans.
  * Market makers.
  * Business regulations.
  * Private vs. public sector.
  * New product lines.
* Key questions that remain.
  * Can someone cash out of their successful business and retire?
  * How to keep the system from enriching the few?
  * Others?
* Summary and next steps.
