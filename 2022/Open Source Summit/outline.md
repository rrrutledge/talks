# Abstract

Open source community management practices do a wonderful job of creating projects that are broadly useful by many groups across the software industry.
These same practices applied inside corporations (InnerSource) can have the analagous result of widely-shared software within the company,
reducing engineering silos and increasing engineering throughput.
Achieving this result in the context of a corporate environment, however, requires unique motivations and structure.
InnerSource activities must be incorporated in alongside sprints, roadmaps, quarterly deliverables, staffing changes and so on.
Come to see the detailed structure and setup that have worked for us to give support to sustained InnerSource in strategic company projects.
We'll review specific suggestions and reference open materials that you can take back and apply to your specific projects and organizations.
