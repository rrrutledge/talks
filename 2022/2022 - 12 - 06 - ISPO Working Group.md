# Abstract

Many of us in the ISC are in charge of the adoption of InnerSource at their respective company.
We all need to teach and enable people and teams at our companies to practice effective InnerSource.
We need documentation and tooling to overcome the challenges associated with adopting InnerSource.
We need training to enable people to apply that documentation and tooling.
Each of us is creating this documentation, tooling, and training within our company.

While no two of our companies are exactly the same, not each company is wholly different, either.
We must work together to create open-source documentation, tooling, training for overcoming InnerSource-related challenges.
We must practice what we preach and stop duplicating work in creating solutions specific to each company.
Since not all companies are the same, there may be more than one solution for a given InnerSource challenge, but there will not be an infinite number of solutions either.

Let us form an ISC working group to document challenges that we have and plan that solutions to those challenges are implemented as much as possible in the open.
Many of these open implementations may result in contributions existing ISC working groups,
but it's also possible that we may start some new projects.
Let's get together to discuss this idea and how to organize ourselves to accomplish it.](

# Outline

* Common challenges facing an InnerSource program.
* Examples in the ISC where multiple companies are solving the same challenges.
* No two situations are exactly the same, not every situation is wholly different.
* We can produce shared documentation, tooling, and training.
* Companies can reuse what applies to them, leave behind what doesn't, and create what's missing.
* We all benefit in having one anothers' work more readily sharable and composable.
* Working group structure: project board and regular meetups.
